  "description1": "With a maximum of 7 questions, you can make a well-founded assessment of whether a data-driven application qualifies as an AI system or as an hihg-impact algorithm. Fill out the dynamic questionnaire. Soon, additional questionnaires will be available for risk classification of AI systems. These questionnaire are primarily focussed on the (Dutch) public sector, but could be very usefull to other countries and sectors",

  "instructionsAI": "When an application qualifies as an AI-system, it has to comply with the EU AI Act. AI-system is a legal definition and it is defined broadly. Therefore an application that most people would not quality as AI, could still by an AI-system in the eyes of the law.",
  "instructionsAlgo": "Not all systems with large impacts on people, are AI systems. The Netherlands has seen many schandals involving algorithms that caused unfair treatment of citizens by the government. The Dutch government responded with a National Algorithm Registry and guidelines for the public sector. Aditionally many Dutch governmental organisations now have (internal) guidelines and policy inplace for responsible use of algorithms.",
